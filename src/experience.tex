  	 \resumeItem{Led the software development for the NCEI’s geomagnetic models: HDGM. }
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Steadily led my team in releasing the HDGM software and web API annually since joining CIRES.
  	\item Developed and deployed the magnetic model to the backend of web API using C and Java Servlet. 
  	\item Maintain the cloud-based backend  and includes APIs for high-resolution models.
  	\item Developed and deployed a logging tool to track user requests, user IPs, and server responses for the HDGM web API by Mockito and Java Serlvet.
  	\item Update the dependency of machine learning backend from Python2 to Python3 with unittest and replacing LSTM layer with GRU with tensorflow. Deploy the machine learning model to the GCP based web service.
  	
  \end{itemize}
  
   \resumeItem{Led the software development for the NCEI’s geomagnetic models: WMM online calculator, WMM Python API, WMM C softwares and WMM GUI.}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Deployed the WMM high-resolution model to the current backend of the WMM online calculator, WMM C software, and WMM GUI by C.
  	\item Collaborated with the NCEI IT team to develop the CI/CD process for the WMM online calculator, enabling deployment of the model backend, web API backend, and frontend to production.
  	\item Integrated components from data preprocessing to the model into the Python API and deployed it across development, testing, and production tiers.
  	
  \end{itemize}
  
   \resumeItem{Updated the shared library for the software backend of geomagnetic models, such as HDGM and WMM, to comply with the requirements of the NCEI IT security review.}
